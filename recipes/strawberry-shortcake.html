        <li>113g cake flour</li>
        <li>23g cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cream</h4>
    <em>Make a day ahead if possible</em>
    <ul>
        <li>500g [100%] Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>150g [30%] Mascarpone</li>
        <li>180g [36%] Condensed Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="red-background">Steps</h3>
    <p>Make components of the cake in the following order: Syrup -> Cream -> Genoise</p>
    <h4>Syrup</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Scale out 60g of cane sugar in small saucepan, add water</li>
        <li>Heat over medium heat just until the sugar is dissolved</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cream</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Scale out cream, mascarpone, and condensed milk into mixing bowl or stand mixer bowl</li>
        <li>Begin whipping on lowest speed until are all ingredients are incorporated and smooth, about 3-5 minutes</li>
        <li>Increase speed to medium-low, and mix until you start seeing traces from your whisk, another 3-5 minutes</li>
        <li>Increase speed to medium, and whisk <em>just</em> until you reach peaks that can stand up on their own, 3-5 minutes -- be careful not go any further than this, or the cream will begin to curdle and take on a grainy mouthfeel</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Genoise</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325F and set the rack to the center of your oven</li>
        <li>Line cake pan with a round of parchment paper to cover the bottom. Line the sides with 4 inch tall strips of parchment paper</li>
        <li>Scale butter, milk, and vanilla in a small heat-proof bowl and set aside</li>
        <li>Scale cake flour and cornstarch in a separate bowl and set aside</li>
        <li>Scale eggs, yolks, sugar, and honey in a heat-proof bowl, whisk to combine</li>
        <li>Fill a medium saucepan with about 2 inches of water, and place over low heat. Once the water is simmering, place bowl with egg mixture over the pan.
             Keep an eye on this mixture, whisking periodically to prevent the eggs from cooking. There is no need to vigorously whisk. Lower heat or turn off 
             completely if needed. Check the temperature of the eggs with your thermometer - we're looking to hit a range of 37C to 40C (approximately body temp). 
             The consistency should become looser and more homogenous as it warms up. Once eggs have reached the target temperature, take the bowl off the saucepan 
             and transfer to a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Keep the saucepan on the stove, cutting the heat if it's still on. Take your heat-proof bowl of the butter/milk/vanilla and leave it directly on the warm water</li>
        <li>With the whisk attachment, begin mixing the eggs on medium-high speed (about speed 4). Set a timer for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, check the consistency of your egg mixture - it should have tripled in volume to a glossy, light yellow color. T
            he mixture should pile up onto iteself and maintain its shape for at least 5 seconds</li>
        <li>With the mixer on its lowest setting, whisk the egg mixture to remove any big bubbles - about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Sift flour mixture over the top. Holding your rubber spatula perpindicular with a slight tilt to the right, cut through the middle of the 
            batter and fold. You should be creating a J shape as your fold. Rotate bowl, and repeat until flour appears incorporated. Gently slide 
            your spatula along the bottom of the bowl towards the center of the batter, and check if there are any dry spots. Repeat the J fold a 
            few more rotations for extra assurance</li>
        <li>Take milk mixture off of the warm water - the butter should be completely melted at this point. Add a few small scoops of batter into the milk and mix completely. 
            This should lighten up the milk mixture so it can be easily incorporated back into the batter</li>
        <li>Incorporate milk mixture into the batter, use your spatula to break the fall when adding it back in the prevent it from sinking to the bottom of the bowl. Start 
            folding the batter immediately - we want to work quickly since adding fat to the batter will cause the batter to deflate rapidly. Look out for any streaks of 
            unincorporated milk. Once everything looks good, check the bottom with your spatula. Repeat J fold a few more rotations</li>
        <li>Pour batter from a height slightly above eye level into your prepared cake pan. Gently smooth out the top with the tip of your spatula, and tap on the counter a 
            few times to knock out any remaining bubbles</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25-30 minutes - the cake should rise up a third of its original volume. You will know the cake is done when the sides have slighly 
            shrunken away from the pan - you can also insert a toothpick to check for doneness</li>
        <li>Remove cake from oven and drop it on the counter to remove any excess air. This will prevent the cake from shrinking any further while it cools.</li>
        <li>Loosen sides of the cake from the pan with a butter knife and invert cake to coop upside down on the cooling rack. After 10-15 minutes, flip the cake 
            to finish cooling right-side up. It is best to leave the parchment on the cake during the entire cooling process to prevent it from drying out any further</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Final Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cake into two halves - top and bottom</li>
        <li>Baste the inner side of both halves with syrup</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of cream on the bottom layer of cake and place a layer of strawberries on top</li>
        <li>Spread one more layer of cream on top of the layer of strawberries and top with the top layer of cake</li>
        <li>Spread cream on the outside of the cake - top and sides</li>
        <li>Decorate outside of cake with strawberries with your design of choice</li>
    </ol>
